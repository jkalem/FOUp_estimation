# FOUp_estimation

Here we can estimate the parameters of a FOU(p) processes from a real time series dataset for p=1,2,3,4.
Taking into account that the FOU(p) processes is centred and stationary Gaussian process, in order to model a real time series dataset,  it is necessary to do the following two steps.
First, it is mandatory that the real time series data set have no trend or seasonal components, otherwise they should remove it.
Second, substract the mean value in order to model a centred dataset.
